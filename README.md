Certainly! Here are 30 C++ programming questions, one per day:

1. Write a program to display "Hello, World!" on the console.
2. Create a program that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum.
3. Implement a program that finds the maximum of three numbers.
4. Write a C++ program to check whether a given number is even or odd.
5. Create a program to calculate the factorial of a number.
6. Implement a program to check whether a number is prime.
7. Write a C++ program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms.
8. Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
9. Implement a simple calculator program with basic arithmetic operations.
10. Write a program to reverse a given integer.
11. Implement a program to find the sum and average of elements in an array.
12. Write a C++ program to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
13. Create a program to find the largest element in an array.
14. Implement a program to concatenate two strings without using library functions.
15. Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
16. Implement a function to calculate the power of a number.
17. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
18. Create a program with a function that finds the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers.
19. Implement a program that uses a function to check if a number is Armstrong or not.
20. Write a recursive function to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series.
21. Create a program to swap two numbers using pointers.
22. Write a C++ program to find the length of a string using pointers.
23. Implement a program to dynamically allocate memory for an array and free the memory after use.
24. Create a program to reverse an array using pointers.
25. Write a program to concatenate two strings using pointers.
26. Implement a simple class representing a bank account with deposit and withdrawal methods.
27. Write a program using file handling to read and write data to a text file.
28. Create a program that demonstrates exception handling in C++.
29. Implement a program that uses templates for a generic function (e.g., swapping two elements).
30. Write a C++ program to implement a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort or Selection Sort).
